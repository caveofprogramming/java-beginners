/*Points to remember =>
1.) Make sure that you have installed the jdk and jre file and set path in Windows(before runn the program)
2.) When we use public keyword with class the class and the file should be same(case-sensitive) or if we use class we can use different file name
3.) Naming convention for class is all the letter should be in Capital. False naming convention will not give error, it make easy to identify the things.
